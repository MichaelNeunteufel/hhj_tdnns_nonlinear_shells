# Hellan-Herrmann-Johnson and TDNNS methods for linear and nonlinear shells

[![lite-badge](https://jupyterlite.rtfd.io/en/latest/_static/badge.svg)](https://michaelneunteufel.github.io/hhj_tdnns_nonlinear_shells/?path=index.ipynb)

We collect and present shell benchmark examples solved with the Hellan-Herrmann-Johnson (HHJ) and tangential-displacement-normal-normal-stress continuous (TDNNS) methods. All benchmarks from the paper [Neunteufel, Schöberl. The Hellan-Herrmann-Johnson and TDNNS methods for linear and nonlinear shells] can be found here.

## How to start 
If you have [NGSolve](https://ngsolve.org) installed locally including jupyter-notebook widgets you can run the index.ipynb notebook in the content folder to navigate through the benchmark examples.

## Examples directly available in the browser
If you don't have NGSolve or want to quickly run the files you can do this directly in the browser via JupyterLite.
